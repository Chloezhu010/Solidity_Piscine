# Project P00 – Hello Ethereum

**Level:** Easy  
**Estimated Time:** 1–2 days  

---

## Objective
Set up your Ethereum development environment and deploy your first smart contract to a testnet.

---

## Learning Goals
- Install and configure **Foundry**, **Hardhat**, and **MetaMask**.
- Write, compile, and test a basic Solidity contract.
- Deploy to a public testnet and verify on Etherscan.
- Understand the workflow of developing and deploying dApps.

---

## Requirements
1. **Environment Setup**
   - Install Foundry and Hardhat.
   - Create a new wallet with MetaMask and get Sepolia testnet ETH.

2. **Contract**
   - Create a `HelloEthereum` contract with:
     - A public string `message`.
     - A `setMessage(string calldata _newMessage)` function.

3. **Testing**
   - Write tests in Foundry:
     - Ensure the default message is set in the constructor.
     - Ensure `setMessage()` correctly updates the message.

4. **Deployment**
   - Write a Hardhat script to deploy the contract to **Sepolia**.
   - Verify the contract on **Etherscan**.

---

## Deliverables
- `HelloEthereum.sol`
- Foundry tests for constructor and `setMessage`.
- Hardhat deploy script.
- `README.md` with:
  - Your deployed contract address.
  - Steps to deploy and verify.

---

## Bonus Challenges
### Gas Optimization
- Measure gas for `setMessage()` using `forge snapshot`.  
- Try to reduce gas by optimizing string storage (hint: short string packing vs dynamic allocation).

### Security
- Add an **owner-only** modifier for `setMessage()` and test permissions.

### Research
- Compare gas usage between deploying with Foundry vs Hardhat.  
- Read: [Solidity docs on storage vs memory](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/internals/layout_in_storage.html).

## Peer Review Defense
Be prepared to explain:
- How you deployed and verified the contract.
- Gas cost tradeoffs when using different string types.
- Differences between Foundry and Hardhat workflows.
