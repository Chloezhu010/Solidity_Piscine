# Project P01 – My First Token

**Level:** Easy  
**Estimated Time:** 2–3 days  

---

## Objective
Create and deploy your first ERC20 token with mint and burn functionality.

---

## Learning Goals
- Understand the ERC20 standard.
- Use **OpenZeppelin** contracts.
- Add custom functionality to an ERC20 token.
- Write unit tests for token behavior.

---

## Requirements
1. **Contract**
   - Use OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 as a base.
   - Add:
     - `mint(address to, uint256 amount)` restricted to the owner.
     - `burn(uint256 amount)` callable by any holder.

2. **Testing**
   - Ensure:
     - Total supply updates correctly on mint and burn.
     - Transfers and allowances work.
     - Only owner can mint.

3. **Deployment**
   - Deploy to **Sepolia** and mint an initial supply to your own wallet.

---

## Deliverables
- `MyToken.sol`
- Foundry tests for mint, burn, and transfers.
- Hardhat deploy script.
- `README.md` with:
  - Token name & symbol.
  - Contract address on Sepolia.

---

## Bonus Challenges
### Gas Optimization
- Replace OpenZeppelin’s ERC20 with a custom minimal ERC20 implementation and measure gas savings.

### Security
- Research and implement a mitigation for the **ERC20 allowance race condition**.

### Research
- Compare your token to real-world stablecoins (DAI, USDC).  
- Summarize differences in mint/burn mechanisms in 1 page.

---

## Peer Review Defense
Be prepared to explain:
- ERC20’s allowance model.
- How you handled mint/burn permissions.
- The tradeoffs between OpenZeppelin’s implementation vs a minimal custom one.
