# Project P08 – Flash Loan Executor

**Level:** Advanced  
**Estimated Time:** 4–5 days  

---

## Objective
Implement a flash loan provider and borrower to simulate atomic arbitrage.

---

## Learning Goals
- Understand atomic transactions.
- Implement flash loans with fees.
- Simulate arbitrage between two AMMs.

---

## Requirements
1. **Flash Loan Provider**
   - `flashLoan(uint256 amount, address borrower)`:
     - Send tokens.
     - Expect repayment + fee in the same tx.

2. **Borrower**
   - Example borrower contract performing simulated arbitrage.

---

## Deliverables
- `FlashLoanProvider.sol`
- `FlashLoanBorrower.sol` (example arbitrage).
- Tests ensuring loan + fee repayment.
- `README.md` explaining atomicity and risks.

---

## Bonus Challenges
### Gas Optimization
- Use inline assembly for ERC20 transfer calls to save gas.

### Security
- Ensure atomic repayment.  
- Validate borrower contract execution to avoid griefing.

### Research
- Read Aave’s flash loan code. How do they enforce atomicity?

---

## Peer Review Defense
Be ready to explain:
- How flash loans work.
- Why they are used in DeFi.
- Risks of poorly implemented flash loans.
