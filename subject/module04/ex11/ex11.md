# Project P11 – Analytics Dashboard

**Level:** Advanced  
**Estimated Time:** 5–6 days  

---

## Objective
Use TheGraph to index DEX data and build an analytics dashboard.

---

## Learning Goals
- Build subgraphs to index on-chain events.
- Query subgraphs in a frontend.
- Visualize DeFi metrics.

---

## Requirements
1. **Subgraph**
   - Index swaps and liquidity changes.
   - Store historical volume and reserves.

2. **Dashboard**
   - Build React dashboard using Chart.js or Recharts.
   - Show:
     - Trading volume over time.
     - Liquidity pool history.
     - LP earnings.

---

## Deliverables
- `subgraph/` schema and mappings.
- `analytics/` React dashboard.
- `README.md` explaining data structure and queries.

---

## Bonus Challenges
### Optimization
- Use event filtering to minimize indexing cost.

### Research
- Compare subgraphs vs custom ETL pipelines.

---

## Peer Review Defense
Be ready to explain:
- Your entity design in the subgraph.
- Tradeoffs between subgraph queries and direct RPC reads.
