# Project P12 – MEV Simulation & Sandwich Detection

**Level:** Advanced  
**Estimated Time:** 4–5 days  

---

## Objective
Simulate a sandwich attack on your AMM and implement protections.

---

## Learning Goals
- Understand MEV and frontrunning mechanics.
- Write scripts simulating MEV attacks.
- Implement basic anti-MEV measures.

---

## Requirements
1. **Simulation**
   - Write a script to frontrun and backrun a victim swap on your AMM.

2. **Mitigation**
   - Add `minOut` checks to reduce sandwich success.
   - Consider commit-reveal order mechanisms.

---

## Deliverables
- MEV simulation script.
- Updated AMM with mitigations.
- `README.md` explaining your attack and defense.

---

## Bonus Challenges
### Research
- Analyze Flashbots and MEV-Boost architecture.
- Summarize 3 types of MEV (arbitrage, liquidation, sandwich).

### Defense
- Simulate private transaction relay (Flashbots-like endpoint).

---

## Peer Review Defense
Be ready to explain:
- Your MEV simulation.
- Why your mitigation reduces sandwich risk.
