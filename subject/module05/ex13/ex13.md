# Project P13 – MEV-Protected DEX

**Level:** Advanced  
**Estimated Time:** 5–6 days  

---

## Objective
Implement an anti-MEV trading mechanism using commit-reveal or other advanced techniques.

---

## Learning Goals
- Design commit-reveal transactions.
- Understand trade-offs between latency and MEV protection.
- Explore MEV-resistant DEX models.

---

## Requirements
1. **Commit-Reveal**
   - Implement a two-step swap process (commit then reveal).
   - Enforce reveal deadlines and penalties for failed reveals.

2. **Evaluation**
   - Compare protection effectiveness against sandwiching.

---

## Deliverables
- `MEVProtectedAMM.sol`
- Tests for commit/reveal logic.
- `README.md` explaining trade-offs and MEV defense.

---

## Bonus Challenges
### Research
- Compare with Uniswap v3’s oracle-based anti-MEV strategies.
- Explore batching or frequent batch auctions as alternatives.

---

## Peer Review Defense
Be ready to explain:
- Why commit-reveal works.
- UX trade-offs of MEV-resistant swaps.
